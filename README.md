# EMS_MVC_.NETCORE_APP
This is simple proof of concept  ASP.NET Core MVC Application developed using .Net 6, Entity Framework Core and MSSQL server Database   
I have build this app to understand how overall Framework works and implement coding techniques Like Dependency Injection using Interfaces, Data Abstraction using Repository pattern  for 
writing codebase which is easy to maintain, modify, extend.
